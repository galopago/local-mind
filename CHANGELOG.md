# Changelog

All notable changes to Link are tracked here.

Release sections use `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versions that match `link-mcp` on PyPI and the MCP Registry. Keep `Unreleased` for work merged after the latest published version.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.6] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Added `scripts/prepare_release.py` to bump MCP release versions, cut changelog notes, and print publish commands without uploading anything automatically.
- Added versioned changelog tracking for repo, PyPI, and MCP Registry releases.
- Added `link.py ingest-status` to show pending raw sources and stale graph indexes.
- Added `link.py doctor --fix` for safe structure creation and backlink repair.
- Added `link.py verify-mcp` to validate local MCP readiness and print client config.
- Added first 10 minutes onboarding docs.
- Added golden demo snapshot tests and direct MCP contract tests.

### Changed

- Polished the graph view with reset, label, and motion controls, keyboard focus, empty-state handling, cursor-centered zoom, and sticky dragged node placement.
- Restructured README.md into a product-doc flow: promise, quick start, first 10 minutes, install paths, then reference and release details.
- Switched release guidance to `release/*` branches and made changelog updates part of the release checklist.
- Refreshed the Link logo.
- Improved first-run and Homebrew/PEP 668 install documentation.
- Narrowed CI trigger noise to pull requests, `main` pushes, and manual dispatch.

### Fixed

- Hardened installers to avoid silently using `--break-system-packages`; they now fall back to `~/.link-mcp-venv` and register MCP with the resolved Python.
- Hardened the local viewer against unsafe graph JSON embedding, path-like wikilink targets, malformed static paths, and local path leakage from static file errors.
- Hardened `link-mcp` tool inputs for empty queries/topics and invalid search limits.
- Expanded `doctor` and release hygiene checks for common credential filenames, private keys, and token patterns.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- Added `link.py demo` for a pre-ingested sample wiki.
- Added `link.py doctor` health checks for structure, backlinks, source hygiene, graph integrity, and secret-looking files.
- Added CI release gates for tests, demo health, installer syntax, package build, version consistency, and release hygiene.

### Changed

- Published `link-mcp` 1.0.5 package metadata for PyPI and the MCP Registry.

### Fixed

- Fixed `/api/context` and MCP context handling for the current backlink index shape.
- Fixed markdown rendering so raw HTML and unsafe markdown links cannot execute in the browser.
- Fixed installers so reruns preserve existing user instructions and project installs point MCP at the project wiki.
- Fixed wiki cache invalidation so edits to existing pages refresh search and context.
- Fixed MCP package reinstall behavior so rerunning installers upgrades `link-mcp`.
- Fixed invalid HTTP search limits to return controlled JSON errors.

## Earlier

- `1.0.2` through `1.0.4` were early public MCP packaging and hardening releases. Use `1.0.5` or newer for public installs.
